# Only-Text Group Chat + Youtube audio download
This project uses django channels to run a group chatroom service. Simply join an existing room or create one to begin texting. To download a Youtube video's audio, begin a text with '!' and type in the name of the video you want to download. This is very effective for music downloading. This project also has a voice note feature which makes the name _Only text_ quite misleading
